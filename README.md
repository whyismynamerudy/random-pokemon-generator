# Random Pokemon Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the Axios library to fetch data from the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) API. It uses ReactJS's useState and useEffect hooks to implement a simple and creative web app.
